The term you're likely referring to is "Crash" rather than "Crush" of the stock market. Stock market crashes are significant, sudden drops in stock prices across a broad cross-section of a stock market. Here's an overview of major stock market crashes in U.S. history:

1. Panic of 1907
   - Caused by: Failed attempt to corner the market on stock of the United Copper Company
   - Result: 50% drop in stocks; banking panic

2. Wall Street Crash of 1929
   - Caused by: Speculative boom in the 1920s, overvaluation
   - Result: 89% drop in stock prices; led to the Great Depression

3. Black Monday (1987)
   - Date: October 19, 1987

Key characteristics of stock market crashes:
1. Sudden and severe price decline
2. Widespread panic selling
3. Liquidity dry-up
4. Potential spillover effects to the broader economy

Factors that can contribute to crashes:
- Overvaluation of stocks
- Economic recessions
- Political instability
- Natural disasters or global crises
- Technological failures
- Market manipulation

Prevention and mitigation measures:
- Circuit breakers to halt trading during extreme volatility
- Improved regulations and oversight
- Better risk management practices
- Diversification of investment portfolios

Remember, while crashes can be devastating, markets have historically recovered over time. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and investing always carries risks.
