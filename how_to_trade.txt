2. Determine Your Investment Goals:
   - Define your financial objectives (long-term growth, income, short-term gains).
   - Assess your risk tolerance.

3. Choose a Broker:
   - Research online brokers (e.g., Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*TRADE, Robinhood).
   - Compare fees, account minimums, research tools, and user interfaces.

6. Create a Diversified Portfolio:
   - Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
   - Consider a mix of different sectors and company sizes.

7. Start with a Practice Account:

11. Reinvest and Rebalance:
    - Consider reinvesting dividends to compound your returns.
    - Periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation.

12. Keep Records for Taxes:
    - Track your trades and dividends for tax reporting purposes.

13. Continue Learning:
    - Stay updated on market news and trends.
    - Consider advanced strategies as you gain experience.

Remember:
- Start small and only invest money you can afford to lose.
- Be prepared for market volatility and potential losses.

Lastly, always do your own research and understand that stock trading involves risk. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
